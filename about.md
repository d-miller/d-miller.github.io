My research interests focus on the intersection of science education, cognitive psychology, and social psychology. Specific interests include the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields, stereotype threat, the role of spatial thinking in STEM disciplines, implicit prejudice and stereotypes, and technology-enhanced education. I use diverse methods such as analyses of large-scale datasets, experimental designs, and meta-analysis to provide converging insights on these research topics. 

I am a third-year graduate student in Northwestern's psychology Ph.D. program. Before Northwestern, I received my B.S. in Mathematical Physics from Harvey Mudd College. My undergraduate thesis project investigated the benefits of spatial instruction among highly gifted science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) undergraduates. I then pursued graduate research through UC - Berkeley's Science Education Research program, while investigating how computer visualizations can help engage diverse students in learning science.
