## About my blog 

My blog broadly targets people looking to strengthen their data skills, as detailed [here](http://d-miller.github.io/Introducing-Blog/). The posts aim to reach people even with beginner technical skills. I'll also talk about interesting data and research, especially about diversity in science and technology. 

## About me

I'm a Northwestern psychology Ph.D. student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow ([see C.V.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MillerCV.pdf)), currently investigating how and why some students move into and out of science and technology fields. Academic journals such as [_Journal of Educational Psychology_](http://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerEaglyLinn2015.pdf) and [_Trends in Cognitive Sciences_](http://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerHalpern2014.pdf) have published my research.

Before Northwestern, I earned my B.S. in Mathematical Physics from Harvey Mudd College and then pursued science education research through UC Berkeley's [Technology Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS) Center](http://telscenter.org/). 

I strengthened my data skills through University of Chicagoâ€™s [Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](http://dssg.io/) where I worked on [a machine learning project](http://dssg.io/2014/11/20/mcps-models-struggling-students.html) to improve student success in high school.
