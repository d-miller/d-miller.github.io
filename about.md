## About my blog 

My blog broadly targets people looking to strengthen their data skills, as detailed [here](http://d-miller.github.io/Introducing-Blog/). Data visualization and machine learning will be core topics, in particular. The posts are intended to reach people even with beginner technical skills. 

I'll likely also talk about interesting data and research, especially about diversity in science and technology fields. 

## About me

I'm a Northwestern psychology Ph.D. student, [currently investigating](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00037/full) how and why some students move into and out of science and technology fields. My C.V. is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MillerCV.pdf).

Before Northwestern, I earned my B.S. in Mathematical Physics from Harvey Mudd College and then pursued science education research through UC Berkeley's [Technology Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS) Center](http://telscenter.org/). 

I strengthened my data skills through University of Chicagoâ€™s [Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](http://dssg.io/) where I worked on [a machine learning project](http://dssg.io/2014/11/20/mcps-models-struggling-students.html) to improve student success in high school.

I'm a NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and [my research](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z8nFnRUAAAAJ&hl=en) has been covered by national and international news outlets including [_Ars Technica_](http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/05/bias-against-women-in-science-persists-even-in-egalitarian-societies/), [_Chicago Tribune_](http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/chi-david-miller-northwestern-women-stem-bsi-20150217-story.html), [_Nature_](http://www.nature.com/news/us-women-progress-to-phd-at-same-rate-as-men-1.16939), [_Psychology Today_](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstein/201105/is-spatial-intelligence-essential-innovation-and-can-we), [_Quartz_](qz.com/385375/good-news-about-hiring-women-in-stem-but-its-not-enough/), [_Science_](http://news.sciencemag.org/social-sciences/2015/05/science-still-seen-male-profession-according-international-study-gender-bias), [_The Guardian_](http://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2015/feb/19/dont-be-fooled-by-the-closing-gender-gap-in-science-phds), [_U.S. News_](http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2015/02/17/report-no-leaky-pipeline-for-women-in-stem), and [_Yahoo News_](http://news.yahoo.com/gender-science-stereotype-strongest-holland-082246004.html).

I also write for popular press and am a contributing writer for [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/). My writing has also appeared in [_Christian Science Monitor_](http://www.csmonitor.com/Technology/Breakthroughs-Voices/2015/0528/When-kids-hear-scientist-most-think-man.-How-can-we-end-this-stereotype), [_IFL Science_](http://www.iflscience.com/editors-blog/beliefs-about-innate-talent-may-dissuade-students-stem), [_Inside Higher Ed_](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/03/03/essay-calls-ending-leaky-pipeline-metaphor-when-discussing-women-science), [_Quartz_](http://qz.com/385375/good-news-about-hiring-women-in-stem-but-its-not-enough/), [_Raw Story_](http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/most-people-think-man-when-they-think-scientist-how-can-we-kill-the-stereotype/), and [_World Economic Forum_](https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/06/why-we-need-to-challenge-beliefs-about-innate-talent-in-stem/).
