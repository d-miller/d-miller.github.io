        <h3>Chicago</h3>
        <p>Data released Friday as part of the Illinois Report Card show 28.4 percent of the state's eighth-graders passed Algebra I — a figure some administrators question because the state only counted students in Algebra I classes labeled "enriched" or "honors," perhaps leaving out students who learned algebra in more general math courses. It's not clear from the data how many students took a qualifying algebra class and, of those students, how many passed. Still, a wide variance in passing rates at individual school districts across Chicago and its suburbs — from 97.1 percent in Schaumburg to 18 percent at Chicago Public Schools to 0.5 percent in Elmwood Park — has left school officials with opposing views on how the data should be interpreted. Some, such as those in Schaumburg District 54, see the measurement as affirmation of major steps taken to improve math instruction and support teachers in recent years.</p>

        <h3>LA County</h3>
        <p>In January of this year (2013), the California Board of Education made a big decision regarding math Grade 8. This decision follows the SB 1200 previously released on September 27, 2012 which authorized the State Superintendent to recommend to the state board, and the state board to adopt, reject, or modify the adopted common core content standards for mathematics by March 30, 2013. In 2014-15, the course for Grade 8 mathematics will no longer be Algebra 1.  Instead, the Board decided to adopt the Grade 8 standards that came with the adopted Common Core State Standards (CCSS) as the course for Grade 8 mathematics students. These students will also be assessed on the CCSS standards using the SMARTER Balanced Assessments.  The CA Board of Education also decided that a pathway be included in the Mathematics Framework for students who are ready to take Algebra 1 at the middle school level. More details will be known when California Mathematics Framework is released this later this Fall (2013).</p>

        <h3>Bay Area</h3>
        <p>Four years ago, school district leaders did something counterintuitive in this tech-laden metropolis, where STEM isn't just a buzzword but practically a way of life. They got rid of accelerated middle-school math classes. Part of an ambitious project to end the relentless assignment of underserved students into lower-level math, the city now requires all students to take math courses of equal rigor through geometry, in classrooms that are no longer segregated by ability. That means no "honors" classes. No gifted track. No weighted GPAs until later in high school. No 8th grade Algebra 1.</p>
