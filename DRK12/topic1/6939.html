<p>The <strong>Energy: A Multidisciplinary Approach for Teachers (EMAT)</strong> project designed, developed, and studied a six-unit, facilitated, online professional development (PD) course. The primary goal of the project was to enhance science teacher knowledge and classroom practice to ultimately improve student science learning. The target audience is high school science teachers who serve students underrepresented in the sciences.</p>
<p>The full course, including<strong> </strong><strong>34 classroom videos, 30 science content animations,</strong><strong> </strong>and <strong>20 interactive learning experiences,</strong> is freely available at <a href="/research-portal/exit.jsp?link=https%3A%2F%2Fbscs.org%2Femat" onclick="dcsMultiTrack('DCS.dcsuri', '/https://bscs.org/emat', 'WT.dl','100');" class="externalLink">https://bscs.org/emat</a>.</p>
<p class="Default">A second goal of the project was to study EMAT to learn how well it supports science teaching and learning. In spite of the rapid expansion of online PD, the development of knowledge about effective PD has been less rapid (Dede et al., 2006). In particular, there has been a dearth of evidence linking PD of any kind to student learning. Most PD research historically is evaluative in nature and fails to attend to longitudinal effects of the PD. We collected data on science teachers and their students to help us understand EMAT and its effects on teachers and students and to provide the science education research field with more information and data about a specific PD model. In our research, we learned the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>EMAT teachers demonstrated improved content knowledge—both in their understanding of the three key energy concepts emphasized in the course and in their understanding of the unit-specific science ideas (e.g., ideas related to the generation of electrical energy using coal and solar sources). The effects were both significant and substantive. That said, the effects were smaller than those that we measured in a related face-to-face professional development project.</li>
<li>EMAT teachers demonstrated improved ability to evaluate classroom video clips for issues related to revealing, supporting, and challenging student thinking and in relation to examining the coherence of science ideas in the clip. Once again, the effect was significant and substantive but not as large as that shown by a related face-to-face model.</li>
<li>EMAT teachers demonstrated higher classroom practice mean scores after the course than prior to the course, but the effect was not statistically significant. The reason the difference was not significant was largely due to the high variability in how the intervention affected the practice of individual teachers. We need further research to better understand the variation.</li>
<li>Students enrolled in high school science courses after their teachers had completed the EMAT course demonstrated greater achievement than their peers who enrolled in the same science courses a year earlier, but the difference was not statistically significant. Once again, variation across teachers seems to have hampered our ability to detect a significant effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>A basic understanding of energy concepts is essential to thoughtful civic participation on issues of foremost national interest. In spite of the importance of energy concepts, many teachers and students lack deep understanding of these essential ideas. Learning about energy and its related issues is especially critical today. The EMAT online course focuses on energy-related concepts. Energy concepts are situated within contexts of the production and use of energy, beginning with coal as a bedrock of our energy-generation capacity and proceeding with investigating energy generation from alternative sources, including nuclear, geothermal, wind, solar, and biofuels. The United States used about 106 exajoules of energy in 2008, yet less than 7% came from renewable sources (US Energy Information Administration, 2008). Energy use in the developing world is growing and is inextricably linked to economic development and the reduction of poverty. Some experts predict that the world’s energy use could grow by 50% by the year 2030 (NAS, 2008). There is a growing national call for action to develop alternative energy solutions to help secure US economic vitality and security and to help mitigate climate change (NAS, 2008). EMAT is leveraging this growing sense of urgency to increase teachers’ motivation to learn and successfully teach about energy. EMAT promotes understanding of energy—crucial understanding for a scientifically literate citizenry.</p>
