title: Visualizing and Thinking About Data
---

Have you ever looked a [_New York Times_ interactive graphic](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html) and thought, “_Wow, that’s so cool_! I wish I knew how to create something like that”? Or are you interested in strengthening your data skills more broadly? If so, this blog may interest you. 

I’m a physicist turned psychologist who’s decided to enter the blogosphere world. My first set of posts will focus on learning skills for creating interactive visualizations, like [this one](http://bl.ocks.org/d-miller/bb1a126a836761758904) I created (screenshot below).

This is my blog’s target audience: 

**People wanting to strengthen their data skills.**

* This audience should be broad, given the rising importance of data skills in all employment fields.

**People interested in thinking deeply about data.**

* I’ll talk about data and research that I find especially important and interesting. [My interests](https://northwestern.academia.edu/DavidMiller) focus on diversity in science and technology fields, but I may cover other topics as well.

**People with a variety of technical and non-technical backgrounds.**

* I’ll focus on more advanced topics like machine learning and interactive visualization, but will provide links for learning more basic programming and statistics skills. 
* So don’t be scared away if you don’t already have a strong technical background! Learning technical skills takes time, but several _free_ online resources can help you do that (e.g., [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/)).

About tools I will cover: 

* I’ll talk about using d3.js, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, R, and (maybe) Python. 
* Don’t worry if you don’t know those names already!
* My blog will not focus on using SPSS and Stata, but may talk about how to transition to new languages from them (that’s what I did). 

About myself:

* I'm a Northwestern psychology Ph.D. student, [researching](https://northwestern.academia.edu/DavidMiller) how to improve diversity – especially gender diversity – in science and technology fields. 
* I first learned data skills as an undergraduate [playing around](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=4&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCsQFjAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.phenix.bnl.gov%2FWWW%2FTPCHBD%2FMiller_HBD_Mtg_8-5-08.ppt&ei=3kMLVbG1IoOfgwS4y4LQAQ&usg=AFQjCNE2W8dlSQ8xNwmYU9Z3xAHSQ_vdjw&sig2=SP3Q8EUxRZwGVZxJN8fTJQ) with massive datasets about high-energy particle physics. I earned my bachelor’s in physics at Harvey Mudd College before moving into science education research and then psychology. 
* I refined my data skills through [University of Chicago’s Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](http://dssg.io/). I learned core machine learning skills by working with two computer science graduate students and one bioengineering postdoc on [a project](http://dssg.io/2014/11/20/mcps-models-struggling-students.html) to improve student success in high school. 
* My CV is here for academic folk. Here’s some media coverage: [Chicago Tribune](http://www.chicagotribune.com/bluesky/originals/chi-david-miller-northwestern-women-stem-bsi-20150217-story.html), [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/us-women-progress-to-phd-at-same-rate-as-men-1.16939), [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstein/201105/is-spatial-intelligence-essential-innovation-and-can-we), [Quartz](http://qz.com/151131/standardized-tests-discriminate-against-the-next-einsteins-and-teslas/), and [U.S. News](http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-solutions/articles/2015/02/17/report-no-leaky-pipeline-for-women-in-stem). I’ve also written for [public audiences](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/03/03/essay-calls-ending-leaky-pipeline-metaphor-when-discussing-women-science). 

So stay tuned for the next post about how to make sexy interactive graphics!
