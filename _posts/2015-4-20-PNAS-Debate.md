I respond to Dr. Zuleyka Zevallos’s critique of the PNAS study on STEM faculty hiring bias by Drs. Wendy Williams and Stephen Ceci. On April 19th, 2015, I submitted the below text as a comment to her blog post. The comment was not published.

Zuleyka, thank you for your engaging and well researched perspective. On Twitter, you mentioned that you were interested in my take on the study’s methods. So here are my thoughts.

Disclaimer: Ceci was the editor of a study I recently published in Frontiers in Psychology. I have been in email conversation with Williams and Ceci, but did not send them a draft of this comment before posting. I was not asked by them to write this comment.
