title: Interactive Table - Gender-Science Stereotypes Across The World

I respond to [Dr. Zuleyka Zevallos’s critique](http://othersociologist.com/2015/04/16/myth-about-women-in-science/) of the [PNAS study](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1418878112) on STEM faculty hiring bias [[her response](http://othersociologist.com/2015/04/16/myth-about-women-in-science/#comment-10552); [my rebuttal](http://d-miller.github.io/PNAS-Debate/#comment-1988072969)].

Zuleyka, thank you for your engaging and well researched perspective. On Twitter, [you mentioned](https://twitter.com/OtherSociology/status/588590370834894850) that you were interested in my take on the study’s methods. So here are my thoughts.

I’ll respond to your methodological critiques point-by-point in the same order as you: (a) self-selection bias is a concern, (b) raters likely suspected study’s purpose, and (c) study did not simulate the real world. Have I missed anything? If so, let me know. Then I’ll also discuss the rigor of the peer review process.

As a forewarning to readers, the first half of this comment may come across as a boring methods discussion. However, the second half talks a little bit about the relevant players in this story and how the story has unfolded over time. Hence, the second half of this comment may interest a broader readership than the first half. But nevertheless, let’s dig into the methods.

# A. Was self-selection a concern?
