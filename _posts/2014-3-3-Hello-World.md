title: Visualizing and Thinking About Data
---

Have you ever looked a [_New York Times_ interactive graphic](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html) and thought, “Wow, that’s so cool! I wish I knew how to create something like that”? Or are you interested in strengthening your data skills more broadly? 

If either answer was “yes,” this blog may interest you. 

I’m a physicist turned psychologist who’s decided to enter the blogosphere world. My first set of posts will focus on learning skills for creating interactive visualizations, like the one below. 

This is my blog’s target audience: 

•	People wanting to strengthen their data skills. 
o	This audience should be broad, given the rising importance of data skills in all employment fields.
•	People interested in thinking deeply about data. 
o	I’ll talk about data and research that I find especially important and interesting. My interests focus on diversity in science and technology fields, but I may cover other topics as well.
•	People with a variety of technical and non-technical backgrounds.
o	I’ll focus on more advanced topics like machine learning and interactive visualization, but will provide links for learning more basic programming and statistics skills. 
o	So don’t be scared away if you don’t already have a strong technical background! Learning technical skills takes time, but several free online resources can help you do that (e.g., CodeAcademy).
