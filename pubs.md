My past and current work falls along three major lines of research:

<ul style="top: 0px; font-size: 0.9em;">
  <li>Line 1: Understanding gender gaps in STEM using large-scale data.</li>
  <li>Line 2: Improving STEM learning using synthesis, educational technology, and spatial thinking.</li>
  <li>Line 3: Advancing methodological innovation in education and psychology research.</li>
</ul>

A fourth category includes popular press articles for disseminating findings to the public.
