**UPDATE: I'm extremely excited to say that I will be an educational researcher at [American Institutes for Research](https://www.air.org/) after earning my Ph.D. in June 2018!**

I'm a Northwestern psychology Ph.D. candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow, expecting to graduate in June 2018 ([see C.V.]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MillerCV.pdf)). My dissertation analyzes nationally representative longitudinal datasets to study transitions into and out of science and engineering. Leading academic journals such as [_Child Development_]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MillerDAST.pdf), [_Journal of Educational Psychology_]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MillerEaglyLinn2015.pdf), and [_Trends in Cognitive Sciences_]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MillerHalpern2014.pdf) have published my research.

Before Northwestern, I earned my B.S. in Mathematical Physics from Harvey Mudd College and then pursued science education research through UC Berkeley's [Technology Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS) Center](http://telscenter.org/). 

I strengthened my data skills through University of Chicagoâ€™s [Eric and Wendy Schmidt Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](http://dssg.io/) where I worked on [a machine learning project](http://dssg.io/2014/11/20/mcps-models-struggling-students.html) to improve student success in high school.

While a graduate student at Northwestern, I reached over 200,000 readers as a contributing writer for [_The Conversation_](https://theconversation.com/), an outlet where content is written by academics and edited by journalists.

## Blog

My blog broadly targets people looking to strengthen their data skills, as detailed [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/Introducing-Blog/). The posts aim to reach people even with beginner technical skills. I'll also talk about interesting data and research, especially about diversity in science and technology.
