I'm a senior researcher at the American Institutes for Research (AIR) focusing on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), especially broadening participation in STEM. I currently lead a portfolio of NSF-funded work as Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI on four NSF grants, including topics such as [children's STEM ability stereotypes](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920401), [undergraduates' motivation and retention in STEM](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2110368), and [gender biases in STEM higher education and workforce settings](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2055422). I’m also a co-founder and current co-director of [AIR's Methods of Synthesis and Integration Center (MOSAIC)](https://mosaic.air.org/), which supports methods innovation across evidence synthesis projects at AIR.

Leading academic journals such as [_Child Development_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerDAST.pdf), [_Journal of Educational Psychology_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerEaglyLinn2015.pdf), and [_Trends in Cognitive Sciences_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerHalpern2014.pdf) have published my research. This work largely uses quantitative methods for research synthesis and analyses of large-scale data sets, including data science approaches that I learned as a 2014 fellow for University of Chicago’s [Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](https://www.datascienceforsocialgood.org/). My research on gender diversity in STEM spans more than a decade.

My passion for STEM education research started as a physics major at Harvey Mudd College, wanting to better understand the varied ways of how students learn scientific concepts and come to identify as scientists. After earning my B.S. in Mathematical Physics, I pursued science education research through two years as a graduate student researcher at University of California at Berkeley’s [Technology Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS) Center](https://wise-research.berkeley.edu/). I then earned my Ph.D. in psychology at Northwestern University with a doctoral dissertation that analyzed nationally representative longitudinal datasets to study transitions into and out of STEM.
