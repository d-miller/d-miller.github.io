## About My Current Position

I'm a senior researcher at the [American Institutes for Research](https://www.air.org/experts/person/david-i-miller) (AIR), a non-profit behavioral and social science research organization, studying gender diversity and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), especially using research synthesis methods.

I currently lead a portfolio of work funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) as Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI on multiple NSF grants, including topics such as [children's](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920401) gender stereotypes about STEM and verbal abilities, [undergraduates'](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2110368) motivation and retention in STEM, [gender biases](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2055422) in STEM higher education and workforce settings, and using [artificial intelligence](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2425651) to accelerate research synthesis. 

I also closely collaborate with NSF program officers as the lead PI for the [ECR Hub](https://ecrhub.org/). This five-year resource center partners with NSF to support and grow communities of fundamental STEM education researchers across the nation who are funded or seek to be funded by NSF's [ECR:Core](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ecrcore-edu-core-research) or [ECR:BCSER](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ehr-core-research-building-capacity-stem-education-research) programs. One recent example includes organizing the [2024 ECR PI Meeting](https://ecrhub.org/ecrpi24). AIR leads this center in [close collaboration](https://ecrhub.org/about-ecr-hub) with Georgia State University, Morgan State University, and Northwestern University.

## Academic and Personal History

My passion for STEM education research started as a physics major at Harvey Mudd College, wanting to better understand how students learn scientific concepts and come to identify as scientists. I worked with cognitive psychologist [Diane Halpern](https://dianehalpern.com/) for my senior thesis project on using spatial training to improve undergraduates' STEM learning. (See [this essay](https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2015/03/03/essay-calls-ending-leaky-pipeline-metaphor-when-discussing-women-science) about my switch from physics to STEM education research.)

After earning my B.S. in Mathematical Physics, I then spent two years as a graduate student working with science education researcher [Marcia Linn](https://bse.berkeley.edu/marcia-c-linn) at the University of California at Berkeley’s Technology Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS) Center, before moving to Northwestern University to earn my Ph.D. in psychology. At Northwestern, I conducted my dissertation on characterizing transitions into and out of STEM, while working with developmental psychologist [David Uttal](https://psychology.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/core/profiles/david-uttal.html) and social psychologist [Alice Eagly](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/who-we-are/faculty-experts/eagly.html). During graduate school, I was an NSF Graduate Research Fellow, which gave me additional freedom to craft my own research agenda early in my doctoral training.

Leading academic journals such as [_Child Development_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerDAST.pdf), [_Journal of Educational Psychology_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerEaglyLinn2015.pdf), [_Psychological Bulletin_](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-50489-001.pdf), and [_Trends in Cognitive Sciences_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerHalpern2014.pdf) have published my research. My research on gender diversity in STEM spans more than a decade, starting with my [published undergraduate research]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/MillerHalpern2013.pdf) on gender differences in spatial skills.

## Methodological Training and Contributions

I specialize in research synthesis and quantitative methods. I’m a co-founder and co-director of [AIR's Methods of Synthesis and Integration Center (MOSAIC)](https://mosaic.air.org/), which supports methods innovation across evidence synthesis projects at AIR. 

I am a trained reviewer for the U.S. Department of Education's [What Work Clearinghouse (WWC)](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/WhatWeDo), which synthesizes high-quality causal evidence of educational interventions (my certifications are in WWC Group Design Standards, Versions 4.1 and 5.0). Through a past [federal contract](https://www.air.org/project/what-works-clearinghouse-statistics-website-and-training-swat) at AIR, I directly contributed to methodological innovations in the WWC's procedures, such as being lead author of Version 5.0 changes to the WWC's statistical formulas for effect sizes and standard erorrs ([Appendix E in the 5.0 Handbook](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/Docs/referenceresources/Final_WWC-HandbookVer5.0-0-508.pdf#page=169)), while closely collaborating with methodologists [Larry Hedges](https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/who-we-are/faculty-experts/hedges.html) and [Ryan Williams](https://www.air.org/experts/person/ryan-williams).

My quantitative training started as an undergraduate physics major, taking classes in linear algebra, multivariable calculus, and computer programming, which I applied during three summer physics internships (in astrophysics, low-temperature physics, and high-energy particle physics). During graduate school, I learned data science approaches such as random forests and neural networks as a 2014 fellow for University of Chicago’s [Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](https://www.datascienceforsocialgood.org/). I later applied these machine learning methods to a [meta-analytic project]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Williams2022.pdf) on K-12 mathematics intervention effects.

Presently, I am co-PI on [a NSF-funded project](https://www.air.org/project/incubating-use-artificial-intelligence-conducting-high-quality-research-syntheses) to use artificial intelligence to transform the practice of research synthesis, led by AIR (PI: [Josh Polanin](https://www.air.org/experts/person/joshua-r-polanin)) with diverse external collaborators, including leaders of two NSF-funded $20M AI Institutes. I am also project director for [an IES-funded methods project](https://ies.ed.gov/funding/grantsearch/details.asp?ID=5730) on the consequences of selective reporting bias in education research, including developing new methods to account for selective reporting with dependent effects (PI: [Martyna Citkowicz](https://www.air.org/experts/person/martyna-citkowicz)).
