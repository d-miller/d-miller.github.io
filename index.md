## About Me

I'm currently a senior researcher at the [American Institutes for Research](https://www.air.org/experts/person/david-i-miller) (AIR) who studies gender diversity and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, especially using research synthesis methods.

I currently lead a portfolio of work funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) as Principal Investigator (PI) or co-PI on multiple NSF grants, including topics such as [children's](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1920401) STEM ability stereotypes, [undergraduates'](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2110368) motivation and retention in STEM, [gender biases](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2055422) in STEM higher education and workforce settings, and using [artificial intelligence](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2425651) to accelerate research synthesis. I’m also a co-founder and co-director of [AIR's Methods of Synthesis and Integration Center (MOSAIC)](https://mosaic.air.org/), which supports methods innovation across evidence synthesis projects at AIR.

I also closely collaborate with NSF program officers as the lead PI for the [ECR Hub](https://ecrhub.org/), an intellectual partnership with NSF. This five-year resource center aims to support and grow communities of fundamental STEM education researchers across the nation who are funded or seek to be funded by NSF's [EDU Core Research (ECR) program](https://ecrhub.org/what-ecr-funds), including the [ECR:Core](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ecrcore-edu-core-research) and [ECR:BCSER](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/ehr-core-research-building-capacity-stem-education-research) programs. AIR leads the ECR Hub in [close collaboration](https://ecrhub.org/about-ecr-hub) with Georgia State University, Morgan State University, and Northwestern University.

## Academic and Personal History

Leading academic journals such as [_Child Development_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerDAST.pdf), [_Journal of Educational Psychology_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerEaglyLinn2015.pdf), [_Psychological Bulletin_](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2025-50489-001.pdf), and [_Trends in Cognitive Sciences_](https://d-miller.github.io/assets/MillerHalpern2014.pdf) have published my research. This work largely uses quantitative methods for research synthesis and analyses of large-scale data sets, including data science approaches that I learned as a 2014 fellow for University of Chicago’s [Data Science for Social Good Summer Fellowship](https://www.datascienceforsocialgood.org/). My research on gender diversity in STEM spans more than a decade.

My passion for STEM education research started as a physics major at Harvey Mudd College, wanting to better understand the varied ways of how students learn scientific concepts and come to identify as scientists. After earning my B.S. in Mathematical Physics, I pursued science education research through two years as a graduate student researcher at University of California at Berkeley’s [Technology Enhanced Learning in Science (TELS) Center](https://wise-research.berkeley.edu/). I then earned my Ph.D. in psychology at Northwestern University with a doctoral dissertation that analyzed nationally representative longitudinal datasets to study transitions into and out of STEM.
